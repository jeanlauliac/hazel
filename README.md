# Hades platform

## Design Principles

-   convention over configuration: an average-sized app should need no configuration;
-   batteries included: an average-sized app should need no extension or external package;
-   simple programming language that appeals to people who haven't programmed before;
-   language should be consistent, concise, and nicely legible;
-   errors, whether in syntax or at runtime, should always be actionable;
-   amazing, delighful developer experience: instant reload, keeps state;
-   encourages self-documenting code with named parameters, etc.

## Nice to have

-   support for number units, ex. "1h" as time interval
-   resource files can be referenced from the code out of the box: images, fonts, text
