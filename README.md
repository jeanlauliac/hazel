Experimental visual app editor.

## Design Principles

-   **Drag and drop:** no need to manually set up flexboxs, columns, sections,
    spacers. Just drag items of content around and leverage automatic guides,
    spacing, and adaptability to container sizing.
-   **Convention over configuration:** pieces of content and forms just work as
    expected from the start, minimal configuration needed.
-   **Batteries included:** an average-sized app should need no external plugin.
    Rich library of form controls and functionalities with built-in validation:
    date pickers (with proper timezone support), toggles, email entry, payment
    card form and processing, rich autocomplete, country-specific postal address
    fields.
-   **Instant preview:** modify an item on your laptop, have it reload instantly
    on your phone, without losing any state.
-   **Visual entities:** create, edit entities in a graph of data that backs up
    your app, connect these entities to content on screen, and connect back
    forms to feed the entities.
